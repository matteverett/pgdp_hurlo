> ... every book ought to be read with the same spirit and in the same manner as it is writ. Thus the famous author of *Hurlothrumbo* told a learned bishop, that the reason his lordship could not taste the excellence of his piece was, that he did not read it with a fiddle in his hand; which instrument he himself had always had in his own, when he composed it.

> Henry Fielding, *Tom Jones*

A 1729 nonsense play by [Samuel Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson_(dramatist)) (1691-1773). No, not *that* Samuel Johnson. More about this work on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurlothrumbo).

Images from [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Hurlothrumbo_or_the_Super_natural_An_ext/OHJZAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0). The scan is fairly good, so please reference it if something is unclear in the png.

The page numbering in this book skips from 28 to 33, but no material is missing (confirmed by reference to other editions) - it appears to be a printing error.

## Proofing

This is an 18th-century book that uses the long s (ſ), which looks a lot like an f. Please proof as a **regular s** (i.e., proof "progreſs" as "progress"). See the [Proofing old texts](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofing_old_texts) page for more information.

Please also make sure you **remove** the [catch-words](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofreading_Guidelines#Single_Word_at_Bottom_of_Page) at the bottom of pages, even if they're the second part of a hyphenated word.
