TO

The Honourable the

Lady <i>DELVES</i>.


/*
MADAM,
*/

When I think of your Goodness, it
gives me Encouragement to put my
Play under your grand Protection; and if
you can find any thing in it worthy of your
Praise, I am sure the <i>Super-Naturals</i> will
like it. I do not flatter when I say, your
Taste is universal, Great as an Empress,
Sweet and Refin’d as Lady <i>Malpas</i>, Sublime
as Lady <i>Sarah Cowper</i>, Learned and Compleat
as Lady <i>Conway</i>, Distinguishing and
Clear as Mrs. <i>Madin</i>, Gay, Good and Innocent
as Lady <i>Bland</i>. I have often thought
that you are a Compound of the World’s
Favourites, that all meet and rejoice together
in one; the Taste of <i>Montagu</i>, <i>Wharton</i>,
-----File: 004.png---------------------------------------------------------
or <i>Meredith</i>, <i>Stanhope</i>, <i>Sneid</i>, or <i>Byrom</i>;
the Integrity and Hospitality of <i>Legh</i> of <i>Lime</i>,
the Wit and Fire of <i>Bunbury</i>, the Sense of
an <i>Egerton</i>, fervent to serve as <i>Beresford</i> or
<i>Mildmay</i>, belov’d like <i>Gower</i>. If you was
his Rival, you’d weaken the Strength of
that most powerful Subject. I hope your
eternal Unisons in Heaven will always sing
to keep up the Harmony in your Soul, that
is Musical as Mrs. <i>Leigh</i>, and never ceases
to delight; raises us in Raptures like <i>Amante
Sposa</i>, Lord <i>Essex</i>, or the Sun. If every
Pore in every Body in <i>Cheshire</i> was a Mouth
they would all cry out aloud, <i>God save the
Lady</i> DELVES! that illuminates the Minds,
of Mortals, inspires with Musick and Poetry
especially,

/*
<i>Your most Humble Servant</i>,

Lord <i>FLAME</i>.

TO

The Right Hon^{ble} the

Lord <i>WALPOLE</i>.


/*
<i>My Good Lord</i>,
*/

I Return Thanks to Heaven, which is in
you, I mean your Taste, that would not
continue, except it was cherish’d with Vertue,
that Parent of Eternal Love; ’tis all
Palate hungers after, intellectual Food, Generosity,
Harmony; the lofty Lines of a
sublime Pen: and these beautiful Perfections
in you, have been the Chief Support of
my Play. At this Time there are as many
fine Poets in <i>England</i> as ever there were;
but they will not write, because they say
there is nothing encourag’d but Noise and
Nonsense. But I believe those Bards are
mistaken; for so long as the Lord Duke of
-----File: 006.png---------------------------------------------------------
<i>Montagu</i>, Yourself, and Mr. <i>Charles Stanhope</i>
live, fine Poetry will not want Encouragement:
tho’ I have nothing to boast of in my
Play, but the Character of <i>Soarethereal</i>, yet
you great Men, that shine among the Angels,
did condescend to support me; and
no one is more thankful than

<i>HURLOTHRUMBO</i>:

OR, THE

<sc>Super-Natural</sc>.




ACT I. SCENE I.


<i>Enter</i> Dologodelmo <i>and</i> Hurlothrumbo <i>meeting</i>.

<i>Dolo.</i> <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>, how goes the Muse?

<i>Hurlo.</i> <i>Dologodelmo</i>, have you heard
the News?

<i>Dolo.</i> What News?

<i>Hurlo.</i> <i>Darno</i>, <i>Urlandenny</i>, and <i>Darony</i>,
have coin’d their Estates into Money.

<i>Dolo.</i> But for what reason?

<i>Hurlo.</i> Certainly Treason.

<i>Dolo.</i> Pray describe yourself in Prose.

/*
<i>Hurlo.</i> It will be describ’d in Blows.
          There’s more in the Wind
          Than the wise Philosophers can find.
*/

<i>Dolo.</i> No Storms, no Rebellions, I hope.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Nothing less, ’tis Pride, curs’d Pride, but let them
climb to fall.
-----File: 010.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Dolo.</i> Pride, Pride is the Serpent’s Egg laid in the Hearts
of all; but hatch’d by none but Fools! Pray what says the
King to these Adventures?

<i>Hurlo.</i> Say! he says and he says not, cares and he cares
not, he’s King and he’s no King; his high-born Soul is
above the Sublunary World, he reigns, he rides in the
Clouds, and keeps his Court in the Horizon; He’s Emperor
of the superlative Heights, and lives in Pleasure among
the Gods; he plays at Bowls with the Stars, and makes a
Foot-ball of the Globe; he makes that to fly far, far out
of the reach of Thought.

<i>Dolo.</i> But if he despises this World, and resides in the
Climes above, how must we fill our empty Troops below?

<i>Hurlo.</i> Oh take no thought for that, for when the least
Spark of the stifled Fire appears, then <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Mars</i>, the
King, will rise with all the Gods to keep the Rebels under:
They’ll make Drums of the Elements and Skies, and beat
up for Volunteers in Thunder.

<i>Enter</i> Sementory <i>and</i> Seringo.

<i>Ser.</i> Can you guess at the Cause of the King’s excessive
Melancholy?

<i>Sem.</i> ’Tis Love, all Love; in his Travels he came to the
Court of <i>Spain</i>, where he fell in Love with <i>Cademore</i>, the
King’s most beautiful Daughter; and <i>Theorbeo</i>, her elder
Brother, is link’d in Friendship with <i>Soarethereal</i>. The
King of <i>Spain</i> has promis’d his Daughter <i>Cademore</i> in Marriage
to the King of <i>France</i>; but <i>Theorbeo</i>’s Passion for our
Soveraign, was the Cause of his helping his Sister in the
Escape from the Arbitrary Power of a Father, and is daily
expected to arrive in this City: So ’tis Fear, Hope, Love is
the Cause of his Distress.

<i>Ser.</i> See, see, what frantick Man is this?

<i>Sem.</i> It is my Lord <i>Flame</i>, distracted in Love with you:
Fall back, let us hear his Soliloquy.

<i>Enter</i> Flame, <i>with a drawn Sword in his Hand, throws it on
the Ground</i>.

<i>Fla.</i> Thou Key of my Soul, unlock me not, I will not
die and leave her behind amongst corporeal Rivals; that she
-----File: 011.png---------------------------------------------------------
was dead, alive, amongst the purest Spirits: Oh that this
too, oh too, too dear, tender fond Heart could yearn, and
sigh no more! Constancy destroys me, Love makes me
Heavenly, and Tears refine the Soul: as a Pilgrim I will
travel till a Hermitage I find; I’ll mourn, I’ll wander
to <i>Ovid</i>’s solitary Tomb; I’ll pity that poor unfortunate
Man; I’ll think of her I love the most, and pour out my
Tears upon him; there will I prostrate myself, and may I
slumber till the heavenly Harmony wakes the sleepy dead.

/*
[<i>Enter</i> Sementory <i>and</i> Seringo.
*/

/*
Oh! the deluding Creature,
Stings me from every Feature;
When you strive to gain me,
You only mean to pain me;
Cruel Deceiver, Heaven leave her,
Let her not come above,
To taste the Sweets of constant Love.      [<i>Exit.</i>
*/

<i>Sem.</i> Oh <i>Seringo</i>, entice not a Man to Love, except you
design to marry: If a radiant Beam dart from the Fire of
the Eye, ’twill touch his Inclination like Nitrous Powder,
and flash through all his Veins, discompose his Faculties,
and infect his Soul: I am sorry for this poor Man, ’tis dangerous
to continue here, let us leave the place.      [<i>Exit.</i>

/*
[<i>Scene changes, and discovers the King Sleeping upon a Couch.</i>
*/

<i>Enter to him</i> Dologodelmo.

<i>King.</i> Oh <i>Godelmo</i>, why hast thou call’d me home to myself?

<i>Dolo.</i> I came according to your Majesty’s Commands.

<i>King.</i> As in Dreams the Souls of Hermits in secret Extasies
are catch’d away by Angels, so was my Spirit in transport
charm’d by the Image I most admire; she retreated,
and at a distance gaz’d and lov’d, then eagerly flying to my
Arms, she stifled me with Kisses; but like to Sin you call’d
me away from Heaven. Oh! my <i>Cadamore</i>, that I might
die always thus to live with thee; for when the Fetters of
Slumber have link’d these Limbs and the Ground together,
when the Chains of Sleep have bound this Body to the
Earth; when these Eyes, these Ears are insensible, I have
-----File: 012.png---------------------------------------------------------
other Eyes that see, other Ears that hear, and myself rejoices
when myself is dead.

/*
[<i>The King sits down and pauses, then rises.</i>
*/

<i>Dolo.</i> The Solitarys wait without, and humbly desire admittance.

<i>King.</i> Do you know their Business?

<i>Dolo.</i> They come with sublime Tidings from the cœlestial
World, and will yield your Majesty pleasure through
their own Simplicities.

<i>King.</i> Let them appear. [<i>Exit</i> Dolo.] These Men despise
the Company of Mortals, and say they delight more
in the Shadow of something, than to converse with a Nothing
in Substance.

<i>Enter</i> Dolo. <i>and six Solitarys</i>.

<i>Primo.</i> My Sovereign Lord, we think ourselves in Duty
bound to inform you of all the Ills that threaten both your
Person and your Crown, that seems to be surrounded by
many Adversaries.

<i>King.</i> How are you inform’d of this?

<i>Primo.</i> In Parable Visionary, deliver’d down and explain’d
in Hieroglyphicks.

<i>King.</i> But after what manner?

<i>Primo.</i> We all in one Night had the fame Vision; gazing
stedfastly upon your Dominions, the Hills sunk down to
Vales, and the Valleys rose up to Mountains, upon which a
Giant stood, swelling huge with arroganting Poison; his horrid
Visage reach’d the Skies, grasping a Sword in his Hand
that flam’d from Earth to Heaven, glittering on high, and
blaz’d in Elemental Fire, upon whose mighty Edge, Death
rode triumphant: Then in Fury, as Lightning upon the
Wing, slunk down, hissing through the Air, the Wind from
which, blasted every Head of us, and this Head is you my
Sovereign Lord.

<i>King.</i> Did this appear to all?

<i>Primo.</i> All, all, all.      [<i>Ex. Solit.</i>

<i>King.</i> If Calamity be the Parent of Wisdom, why do the
Afflicted depend on Dreams?

<i>Dolo.</i> Your Majesty has no cause to fear.

<i>King.</i> If <i>Hurlothrumbo</i> is brave, there is no danger.
-----File: 013.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Dolo.</i> Was not his Courage truly try’d in <i>Rome</i>.

<i>King.</i> But after what manner?

<i>Dolo.</i> By the Emperor’s Imperial Command he was forc’d
into the Amphitheatre, there to be devoured by the hungry
Jaws of a Lion; disarm’d he enter’d, taking from his Heel
his Ammunition Spur, he wrench’d it wide, and gripe’d it
thus.

<i>Enter</i> Hurlo.

<i>King.</i> <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>, give me a Description of the
Combat.

<i>Hurlo.</i> The Door of the Den was no sooner lifted up,
but the Monster hugely rouz’d himself aloft, stalking gravely
he enter’d, flinging from his Talons sedentary Pain, with
Scarlet fiery Ogles ken’d all around; but when I saw the
Beauty of <i>Greece</i>, my Heart was all Granade, I had an Army
within, a Centry guarded every Pore, and this Compound
of Elements thundred. The Lion came at me amain,
with Jaws open, dreadful as the Mouth of Hell, he sprang
aloft, I glanc’d, he mist me, then with rebound he turn’d,
and by the Main I caught him as he flew, and over his Back
I threw myself astride; then with my Knees I crush’d his
Ribs and Heart together, and with my Right-hand Spur I
cleft his Skull: I bruis’d the Pan of his Brain, till Flashes of
Lightning flew swift from his Eyes; I stabb’d his Sight, he
twisted, he grinn’d, he turn’d and loose he broke, bloodily
blind as he was, in raging Storms, in circling Whirlwinds
flew; his burning Heart, that swell’d with Anguish, Fury
and Revenge; his Talons tore the Earth, rent the Flints, he
gnaw’d the Ground, and Choler boiling over, churning
Dust, Blood and Foam, he roar’d tremendous.

<i>King.</i> ’Tis a furious Description; but how did you conquer
him?

<i>Hurlo.</i> My Coat I roll’d up thus, and hurl’d it to his
Breast; then eagerly grasping the Prey, I march’d towards
him, I spurn’d at his Heart; he reel’d, I retreated; he recover’d,
I advanc’d; again I struck, then trembling, he disgorg’d
a Flood of Gore, and stifling with the Stream, bolt
upright he rose; I pursued my Strokes, he fainted, he sunk,
he shiver’d, he died.
-----File: 014.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>King.</i> <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>, ’tis bravely done; search out into all
the World, pick the Universe, bring to me every thing
that’s noble in the Mind, empty of Ambition and full of
Greatness, that I may feast their Bodies and satisfy my own
Soul; for when my Crown adorns the Head of a worthy
Man, then I enjoy it, and wear it truly, in the inward Raptures
of my Heart.

<i>Hurlo.</i> ’Tis most certain the learned <i>Larmo</i> is worthy of
Honour.

<i>King.</i> I know him well, he has a thousand Perfections,
though in him I discern the Spark of Avarice, it seem’d to
me like the infernal Eye of <i>Lucifer</i>, ’tis a Canker that encreases
and infects the Mind, let no such Man be trusted;
give me he that is like <i>Theorbeo</i>, that has ventur’d and lost
his Crown for his Friend: Is he yet arrived?

<i>Hurlo.</i> He is.

<i>King.</i> Go tell him, I’ll come and rejoice in his Presence.

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> King <i>and</i> Dolo.
*/

<i>Enter</i> Urlandenny <i>and</i> Darno.

<i>Urlan.</i> <i>Darno</i>, a good Day to you, how prospers our Design?

<i>Darn.</i> Far exceeding our Expectation, I’ve sold my Estate
for a hundred thousand Pounds; it is to be return’d
for the same Money, if I require it, in seven Years.

<i>Urlan.</i> Mine is equally secured; this is a Defence against
Ill, but now we’ll speak for thy self; I am inspir’d with a
Thought that will overthrow the Government, that makes
as strong as <i>Atlas</i>; I’ll make——

<i>Enter</i> Flame.

<i>Fla.</i> The Flight takes me in the Head to give you a Description
of the War of Angels, the black ones and the
white ones; now you are of the dark kind, but they were
conquer’d.

<i>Urlan.</i> How Prophetick the Man talks, as if he knew our
Designs? The Tongues of Children, Fools and Madmen
have often fortold my Fate.

<i>Darn.</i> You are superstitious.
-----File: 015.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Fla.</i> And as I was saying, Army in Array against Army,
stood solemn, profound, before the Cloudy Van, Expectation
stood in Horrour, and <i>Satan</i>, with vast and haughty
Strides advanc’d, came touring, arm’d in Adamant and Gold.

<i>Enter</i> Darony.

<i>Dar.</i> Who do you mimick, my Lord?

<i>Fla.</i> The Devil, Sir.

<i>Dar.</i> I resent it.

<i>Fla.</i> Draw.

<i>Urlan.</i> Hold, he is repeating a Passage in <i>Milton</i>; his Wit
is borrow’d, he’s a Moon-light.

<i>Dar.</i> I’ll excuse him as a Lunatick.

<i>Urlan.</i> I recommend to thee a Miss, as a Specifick to assuage
this mighty Fever in the Brain.

<i>Fla.</i> I am unstain’d, not touch’d with any black Crime,
above the World, upon a lofty Mountain, and next Neighbour
to the Sun.

<i>Urlan.</i> Now condescend the Woman lies two Yards below
you, go down, tick, toy and play with her, ’twill cool
your Blood, and sweeten your sour Juices.

<i>Fla.</i> Then how shall I ascend again to my grand Original
Height? ’tis up Hill; Woman pulls, Nature hangs
heavy upon the feeble Soul, and Resolutions weak; no,
Conscience is an intellectual Caul that covers the Heart, upon
which all the Faculties sport in Terror, like Boys that
dance upon the Ice, if one cracks, another breaks, then all
together plunge in over Head and Ears most horrid.

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> Flame.
*/

<i>Urlan.</i> Pray what new Adventures at Court?

<i>Dar.</i> A poor King is arrived at Court, and <i>Dologodelmo</i>
Oratorys high Encomiums upon the mighty <i>Soaretherial</i>,
declares he’s like the glorious Sun, extends his Beams to
all and every part of the World; and as he rides along
the <i>Meridian</i> Course, every feeble Plant beneath him is
cherished, and rises up revived.

<i>Urlan.</i> The Simile is not good: The Sun gives Life to
the Plants that reside far off, but those that grow under
him are burn’d, and scorch’d to Ashes. ’Tis plain, Foreigners
are most encourag’d, and we that pay the Taxes receive
-----File: 016.png---------------------------------------------------------
not the Benefit of Office; <i>Soaretherial</i> declares all
the World are his Country-men, and he that has the greatest
Soul, to him is the nearest a-kin: but to the Purpose,
what’s to be done? The Mob of this City must be highly
prejudic’d in our behalf.

<i>Dar.</i> They are all secure to a Man; I have distributed
amongst them a hundred thousand Pounds; let’s away to
the Lord <i>Urme</i>, he will strengthen our Design.

<g>SCENE</g>, <i>Cademore</i>’s Apartment.

<i>Enter</i> Cademore <i>and</i> Lusingo.

<i>Lusin.</i> My good Lady prepare, the King comes.

<i>Cade.</i> O <i>Lusingo</i>! I could longer taste the Sweets of Expectation
dear, I’d view the beautiful œconomy of this
Court, his Person at a distance, and Motion of his Soul, that
moves and reigns in my Breast; we may enjoy the greatest
Bliss too too soon. Was I to leave this World, and take
my Flight to the celestial Heights, I’d first visit yon distant
Moon; then tow’ring high I’d visit the brightest Situation
of the Sun; then climb amazed up to the Stars; I’d taste
the Sweets of every Orb, before I enter’d Heaven.      [<i>Ex.</i>

<i>Enter</i> King, Theorbeo, <i>and</i> Hurlothrumbo.

<i>King.</i> <i>Theorbeo</i>, thy constant Heart mourns for thy Mistress,
not for the Loss of thy Crown; the Powers are jealous of
Love like thine, and Heaven is only worthy of it, and only
capable to make a return.

<i>Theo.</i> Your Majesty talks like a separate Soul, not like
one that is cloathed with Nature.

<i>King.</i> I beg pardon, I touch your Sore; I long to attend
thee to the Throne with a hundred thousand Men.

<i>Theo.</i> I return your Majesty thanks; yet hope, that no
one will venture his Life for me: the Life of a Friend is
more than a Kingdom.

<i>King.</i> Venture my Life! what is my Life? let me not
pass through this World, the common Road to Eternity;
fade away through the blasting Word from on high, that
-----File: 017.png---------------------------------------------------------
mingles with the Air, and makes all Men mortal; I had
much rather surrender this Life up an offering, and die in
the Service of some dear Friend; in Vehemency of Spirit,
and Fervency of Friendship, I could plunge through a Flood
of Fire to deliver a Friend from the Jaws of a Lion.

<i>Theo.</i> I do believe ’tis in your Majesty’s Power to establish
me upon my Throne; but all Nature in my Breast is
chang’d; that which is Gall to another, is Honey to me:
Life is bitter, and makes Death sweet. What is a Post of
Honour to a Man who thinks he has enough, and has no
Ambition? He that will be rich, must destroy Ambition;
Ambition is a Monster not to be fed, never satisfied till he
is starved out.

<i>King.</i> ’Tis true, <i>Hurlo</i>; from whence proceeds Ambition?

<i>Hurlo.</i> A Man’s Heart and his Bladder changes Places.

<i>King.</i> And what is Honour?

/*
<i>Hurlo.</i> Honour is, and it is not; yet Honour is to be found.
*/

<i>Theo.</i> My Intellect has rang’d in pursuit of Honour
throughout the Universe, nay, even to the Skies, but found
it not.

<i>Hurlo.</i> O it’s on t’other side, my Lord.

<i>King.</i> O <i>Theorbeo</i>, I admire how a Man can so much despise
Power?

<i>Theo.</i> True Power lies in the Mind, or Strength that
can sway the Faculties.

<i>King.</i> I beg pardon for interrupting; I must beg leave
to see the Lady your Sister.

<i>Cade.</i> Oh he’s here! O my Soul starts, and my Heartstrings
shiver!

<i>King.</i> O my <i>Cademore</i>, now I live: as that great Sun revives
this lower World, and makes all Nature rejoice in his
Presence; so you cherish and revive my Heart, all my Faculties
rise up in Raptures: A thousand sublime Thoughts

spring up in my Soul: Is there any thing in my Kingdom
can yield you Pleasure.

ACT II.


<i>Enter</i> Urlandenny <i>and</i> Darony.

<i>Daro.</i> What News, my Lord?

<i>Urlan.</i> All things are in readiness according
to your desire; <i>Darno</i> is raising an Army in
the <i>North</i>, <i>Lomporhomock</i> is now landing in the <i>South</i> with
20000 Men, and when the Tidings reach the King’s Ears,
he’ll extend his Army to the <i>North</i> and to the <i>South</i>; then,
when his Forces have left the City, the 500 Men which I
have hired, for what Purpose they know not, but exactly
at two a-Clock in the Morning, each Man is to fire a
Gun upon the House-top; this repeated three times, will
drive every wandering Soul home to his Body, and raise
him from Sleep surprized.

<i>Daro.</i> That’s true.

<i>Urlan.</i> You and I with a small Body of Men, will march
through the City with a Shout, saying, The City is surrounded
with Foreigners, Fire and Sword, Fire and Sword!
rise, rise quickly, rise to Arms.
-----File: 019.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Daro.</i> That’s good; then in a moment’s time we shall be
at the Head of 100,000 Men.

<i>Urlan.</i> We’ll plunder Misers Houses, distribute their
Bags, hurling the Coin among them, like Hounds besmear’d
with the blood of Prey, mount Resolution upon the Heart,
ride furiously, Whip and Spur, and with deep mouth’d
Tones, full Cry, and in that Vehemence of Spirit, they
will devour a savage Lion. We’ll prejudice them against
the King, lead them to the Court, and take possession of
all.

<i>Daro.</i> So farewel, my Lord; remember two a-clock.

/*
[<i>Exeunt severally.</i>
*/

<i>Enter</i> Sementory <i>and</i> Seringo.

<i>Serin.</i> <i>Sementory</i>, to thy Tire.

<i>Sem.</i> I’m weary of Dress, pall’d with Pleasure, sick of
the event of vain Hopes: Some say that Marriage is made
in Heaven; but ’tis my Opinion, if all the Harlots were
sent to the Grand <i>Turk</i>, there would be more Weddings
celebrated in Heaven than there are; I perceive the Fire
of the Men is all out.

<i>Serin.</i> Very true, <i>Sementory</i>.

<i>Sem.</i> They gaze upon a Woman, as they do upon a Bill
of Fare after Dinner.

<i>Sem.</i> Oh <i>Seringo</i>! where shall I find a vertuous Man, like
such a one that I have seen, chaste, and full of Rapture?
Rapture is the Egg of Love, hatched by a radiant Eye,
that brings to Life a <i>Cupid</i> in his Breast. In thy Company
he’s tasteless of Food and Wine, he’s restless, he’s empty
of Words, and full of Sighs, is in a shivering Ague chill’d;
then in a moment rais’d by the high Fever of Love, is in
extatick Raptures, his Opticks are like two Balls of Fire,
and look as fierce as if he took Gunpowder-Snuff; could
you love such a one?

<i>Hurlo.</i> The King will instantly wait upon your Majesty;
but is now engaged in the Affairs of the Government.

<i>Theo.</i> After what manner are you govern’d?

<i>Hurlo.</i> Spiritually and Temporally, King, Lords, Commons,
Parsons, Clergymen and Divines,

<i>Theo.</i> What is a Parson?

<i>Hurlo.</i> A Parson is——I beg pardon, the King
comes.      [<i>Ex.</i> Hurlothrumbo.

<i>Theo.</i> <i>Adam</i> before <i>Eve</i> was made, longed for something
he knew not what; I long for something more than <i>Eve</i>, I
know not where.

<i>Enter</i> King.

<i>King.</i> <i>Theorbo</i>, why meditate yon thus? that Soul of
thine that came from Heaven, longs to leave me, to soar
aloft and travel home; grieve not thus for a Woman, I
myself am tender, yet bold; I often weep in a fine Lady’s
Presence, but in a moment can conquer that Passion, and
-----File: 021.png---------------------------------------------------------
venture my Life with a Lion; can lay my Hand under the
Foot of an humble Beggar, or take a lofty Emperor by the
Nose.

<i>Enter</i> Hurlothrumbo.

<i>King.</i> <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>, what Tidings from the World?

<i>Hurlo.</i> Not any that will please your Majesty; here are
some poor Men petitioning you for Charity.

<i>King.</i> That will doubly please me; I relieve them as
Men, and satisfy the Thirst of Compassion, at the same
time, my Soul’s invested with sacred Pride, think I am
highly honour’d, and entertain the Gods.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Here is also a poor Prince sends to borrow Money.

<i>King.</i> That will also please me; I receive the Borrower
with more Joy than him that comes to pay a Debt.

<i>Enter</i> Flame.

<i>Flame.</i> Beggars be gone, these Men sell Land upon the
blue Plains; see what a Figure they cut, who’ll buy any?
Oh you, I know you well, (<i>pointing to the King</i>) you are
the most covetous Man in the Universe, you give what you
have away to the Poor, that you may enjoy it all yourself;
and when your time is to die, you’ll not leave a Farthing
behind you to fling away. I return you thanks for the Post
of Honour you offered me; but does your Majesty think a
Soul like mine was born for Servitude? No; I’ll sooner be
an <i>Alexander</i> in my own Park-Pale: He that lives in Pleasure
runs up a Score, and he that is afflicted, is paying
Debts; this is Spirit; what has Flesh to do with that? A
Coquet in the Soul, a Harlot for the Devil. I am a Man
amazed in Love, Nature is hot and too much fudled with
Fire; in the out-raging Jealousies of my Soul, I rent my
Brain, and when my Rival was with her. I ran distracted
to her Cheeks, I kiss’d, I curs’d, I bless’d, I wept, an
Earthquake in my Breast, Thunder and Lightning in my
Head, that storm’d down Tempest, and burst my Heart.
Oh what is Woman! I am sadly in Love, I am not well;
do kill me, O pity a Lover.      [<i>Ex.</i> Flame.
-----File: 022.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>King.</i> <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>, what is thy Opinion of this Man?
my prophetick Soul loves him.

<i>Hurlo.</i> I advise him to starve himself, from a Horse to a
Man; for if he dies at this time, he’ll be metamorphos’d
into a wild <i>Elysian</i> Colt.

/*
He’ll cock his Tail, he’ll praunce and stare,
Will gallop, snort, and snuff the Air;
And all his Thoughts will be of——
*/

<i>King.</i> Pray tell me how does Love affect thee?

<i>Hurlo.</i> When I see a Lady with a full Chest, flat Back,
falling Shoulders, a long Neck, and a languishing Air, every
Pulse beats up a March vehemently towards her; I touch,
I muse, I am in a Trance, a pleasing Stupidity, Astunment,
my Faculties are on fire, a Smoak rises in the Eyes of the
Mind, Reason is deaf, the Intellect blind, my Nerves
creep, I shiver; charm’d in Terror, the Body trembles in
the Bargain of buying Raptures with the Soul.

<i>King.</i> ’Tis not Love, it’s Temptation.

<i>Hurlo.</i> ’Tis a Description of a Combat, in which all Men
are conquer’d.

<i>King.</i> Not so, <i>Hurlo</i>, I will speak for myself: Ambition
high rose up in the Mind, to fight with Vertue, in the beauteous
Fair; and she a superlative <i>Venus</i> of the World; I
was Fire, and Faculties keen; she was Love with languishing
Retreat, but when she surrendred all to my Will; I
struck not the Vanquish’d, but conquer’d myself.

<i>Hurlo.</i> ’Twas a noble Retreat, your Majesty bravely run
away.

your Majesty.

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> Theorbeo, Hurlo, <i>and</i> Servant.

Breast of late, restless Nights, horrid Visions, affluster’d
Spirits fly around my Heart; my prophetick Soul, like
<i>Argus</i>, discerns Destruction approaching.

Goodness will oblige you to pardon.

<i>Dolo.</i> Lord <i>Darno</i> has sold his Effects at home, and is
now raising an Army in the Northern Parts of your Majesty’s
Dominions; <i>Darony</i> and <i>Urlandenny</i> are set out for the
South, with the same Design.

<i>King.</i> Go, <i>Dolo.</i> and bring <i>Theorbeo</i> hither to me. [<i>Ex.</i>
Dolo.] Oh, who shall deliver me from the Contagions of
Mortals! that I had been born in humbler State: Ye rural
Shepherds, ye Companions of Angels, I envy you: that I
could be like to you, my Ambition only to reach the Top
of a Mountain, to lean upon my Staff, there to admire the
beautiful Œconomy of the Universe, listen to the Linnets,
Larks, and Nightingales, that warble forth their Praise on
high; to the Sun they offer up their Joy: these would
teach me to be grateful. Of my Lambs, that innocently
sport all around me; of them I will learn Humility, and despite
your Arrogance: my Dog, that scouts upon the Plain,
I’ll compare him with you, and blush for you: he loves
more, and is constant, a fervent Friend, will fight till Death
for his Master, rises not up against him when he smites him;
he’s grateful, he flatters not, and to your shame, has more
Compassion; for with his Tongue he’ll heal the Wound of
the Oppressed. Ye Rationals, learn of Brutes; and teach
me to abhor Mankind.      [<i>Exit.</i>

<i>Enter</i> Theorbeo <i>and</i> Dologodelmo.

<i>King.</i> <i>Theorbeo</i>, you say your desire is to exert yourself
in the War, I had much rather you’d stay; what say
you?

<i>Theo.</i> ’Tis my desire, that my Spirits may rouze and
shake off these heavy Elements; the shining of my Soul is
over-whelm’d with Clouds, I long to discharge this heavy
Hail-storm upon the Heads of all your Adversaries.

<i>King.</i> <i>Godelmo</i>, is there any danger?

<i>Dolo.</i> There is not; when the Enemy hear the King’s
Trumpet sound, it will be as when the Lion roareth in the
Forest, every Monster’s Heart will tremble, and in a moment
fly to their Dens for shelter.

<i>King.</i> See that Draughts are made out of my Troops,

out of Breath?

<i>Hurlo.</i> Out of Breath! I may well be out of Breath, the
Wind may well rise, the Conjurers are all at work, I have
a Tempest in my Belly.

<i>Dolo.</i> Pray let the Storms cease, and let me hear the Cause.

<i>Enter</i> King.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Cause! Cause enough; one <i>Lomporhomock</i>, a <i>Dutch</i>
Officer, is just landed with 200,000 Men.

and I’ll give them the meeting myself.

to crack; but as the Lightning flies before the Thunder-clap,
so shall <i>Darony</i> fly before me, or Death shall

what Adventures will happen, the cause of the Guns firing
thus early?

Day, and all us Mortals act in yonder Climes: I see myself,
I see <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>; <i>Hurlo</i> kisses a Lass; the Spirits smile;
I stir my Hand, it moves yonder. <i>Mars</i> stands in the Element,
and beholds the People; they divide, and make two
separate Armies; Death stalks among the Croud, marking
his own Appointed. Oh! he makes towards me! oh!
he’ll touch me; take it I’ll see no more.

three Minutes! if my trembling Limbs permit me, I’ll kneel,

Rogues are coming, they’ll rob me, take my Plate, and

Deity is deaf, with your squinting Soul that kens both
Earth and Heaven; fling your Bags into the Elements,
then will you look straight upright: Be gone, what hast
thou to do in this World? What dost thou mean?

<i>Puny.</i> I mean to be the Root of a Family.

<i>Urlan.</i> If the Root be Avarice, what will the Body,
Branches, Leaves and Fruit be? Twenty Generations must
pass away, before thy Seed can be refined so far, as to produce
a Gentleman.

<i>Puny.</i> Is not Gold a Gentleman, a Person of Quality?
What makes a Gentleman?

<i>Urlan.</i> Education, Honour, and Generosity; add to a
fine Gentleman Love, Resolution, Taste; a Person of Quality
has all these Perfections, and is discerning, with a sublime
Thirst in the Soul; a longing to reward Merit; fervent
to serve the meanest, and punctual to his Word; his
Blood is double and treble refin’d; he’s full of Heaven;
a Sunfire; a Light that quenches all the Flame of Nature;

with a Prince of the Air, and their Nostrils are full of the
Devil.      [<i>Ex.</i> Pun. <i>and</i> Tem.

it is secured.

<i>Dar.</i> I hope there is no Danger.

<i>Lom.</i> ’Tis my earnest Desire that you will instantly execute
the King; for while he’s living, all his Friends will
rouse up like Lions, but when they hear he’s dead, ’twill
greatly oppress their Souls.

<i>Dar.</i> He shall instantly be executed.

<i>Lom.</i> Then I’ll march in Pleasure, and meet his Army.

<i>King.</i> Let them strike me, let these Clouds pass away;
let them break the Sky within me, that I may truly see, enter
Orbs like the Sun; see Spirits, Angels, and the radiant
Fields: but what is that to a Man in Love, a Man whose
Heaven’s here? Oh my <i>Cademore</i>, who can bear the Pangs
of parting! since we must part, ’tis death to live.

<i>Enter</i> Cademore.

<i>King.</i> O Executioner art thou come, bring to me a Taste
of Torment, a Rack of Nature, like Heaven’s Vengeance,
to afflict my Soul? Still thou art my Friend, and something
more than Woman, my Prospect-Glass to Paradise; thou
Emblem of Eternity; oh how great’s my Thought of Heaven,
whilst my Eyes are fix’d on thee! For if the way to live
with you, lay through the Shades of Misery, to lodge in
tremendous Caves of Darkness, one single Thought of thee
would fill Obscurity full of Light, and make it like a Palace
adorn’d with Diamonds: but now, oh now, what is my
Hope, a Man is never destitute of Hope; but my dear Expectation,
my Spring of Life, is now become the Sting of
Death: for every Thought of thee shoots through my
Heart; and at a Sight of thee, oh ye Goddess! that I could
love thee less, and Heaven more.

<i>Cad.</i> I am sorry I encrease your Grief, I come in hopes to
mitigate your Pain; for every Sigh that proceeds from you,
pursues me, and ecchoes in my Breast.

<i>King.</i> That I believe, it must be so; ’tis so in Love, ’tis
so in Musick, ’tis so in Souls; the fine in Raptures sympathize
with cœlestial Joys, revived by all their Unisons in
Heaven; but to free thee from Pain, I’ll think no more of
Life below, but fly to nobler Thoughts, and pursue my
Hopes in Happier Climes.

<i>Cad.</i> Cease not to vent your Grief for my Relief, ’tis my
Delight to share with you in Suffering; but rather wish that
all may be fixed on me, that I may take them to some gentle
Stream, and then to lay me down to stifle all in Waves;
and there, oh there, let my Spirit expire.

<i>King.</i> Nay, no more of that, if thou be my Friend,
hate me, be lewd, be infamous, that I may banish thee;
-----File: 030.png---------------------------------------------------------
oh let me banish thee from every Glance of Thought, that
I may take my Sleep, my lasting Sleep in Peace.

<i>Cad.</i> Name not that to me.

<i>King.</i> Name not what?

<i>Cad.</i> Your Death, my Lord.

<i>King.</i> ’Tis Death to resign up thee, to yield thee into others
Arms; oh my <i>Cademore</i>, be a Virgin still, for if you
marry, you part from me, and make me jealous in Eternity.

<i>Cad.</i> Let no Thought of that arise, the Pangs of your
Death will always smart in me, keep me from all and every
Thought of Man.

<i>King.</i> The Pangs of my Death smart in thee, there is no
pain in Death, the Sound of your Words is Musick to my
Soul, and makes the ever-living Youth rejoice, and leap
for Joy, being ripe for birth, desires to go to Life; but
this Body, this timorous Mother Earth; alas she shivers,
and dreads the Hour of her Travail, but when that Midwife
Death in Life shall give me Birth, Oh! may it be in
that Kingdom where thou in long Eternity shall shine; and
if my Happiness be no more than what I conceive in thee,
and that to last for ever, then let the World say I am nothing,
I am dishonourable, the Crown of my Head is dropped
from the Kingdom of my Body, so that I may say I
live with thee, but when we part.

<i>Cad.</i> O my Soul!

<i>King.</i> O Heaven!

<i>Cad.</i> Oh Angels!

<i>King.</i> Burst Heart, and let me fall.

<i>Cad.</i> Oh Death! quickly to my Aid.

<i>King.</i> Oh my <i>Cademore</i>, live!

<i>Cad.</i> If it must be so, come visit me after Death.

<i>King.</i> Oh how can I promise that? If this great Sun
should refuse his Heaven, and slide from Orb to Orb, leave
the Elements, prostrate himself on the Earth, fall a Victim
at thy Feet, it would only serve to surprize and fire
thy Heart; blind thy mortal Eyes; and lest the Garment
of the Intellect be thus incomparable and Glorious, make
me not promise, for if I promise, ’twill make me uneasy in
Heaven, ’till I perform my Word; but if I can entreat to
thy Guardian Saint, then I’ll attend thee all the Day, hover
-----File: 031.png---------------------------------------------------------
and settle upon thy Pillow all the Night, where I’ll
converse with thee in Visions, and when thy Time is full
done, I’ll wait and watch the closing of thine Eyes, and then
will I catch away thy Soul in a Divine Transport; with Cœlestial
Wings we’ll soar to the Lofty Mountains in the
Clouds, when they shall dissolve like a Bed of Down; our
inward Hearts shall kiss each other in Love, in Extasy, and
then we’ll fly away together from all Adversity.

it was my fear they would conquer thee, and bring thee to
this Place of Adversity.

trusty Hands, and am come here, that you may make your
Escape in my Habit; and by that Time you have reach’d
to the Army, I being a Stranger, will pass the Centry again,

Oh <i>Theorbeo</i>, grieve not, every Sigh of thine, will make
my Heart to weep Drops of Blood; consider a small Affliction
by chance may happen; but these great Calamities,
must proceed from something Great; and if so, it is Philosophy
to rejoice.

for Divinity: I am sometimes at wars with my Will, whether
to fly to Sin for Refuge, or to Heaven for Relief.

to see you again.

and my Soul join with his Adversary; I’d fly swiftly with
the Ball, and direct it to his inward Heart.

<i>Theor.</i> Curse him not; has he deserted you?

<i>Dolo.</i> We no sooner entered the Field, but he joined the
Adversary; may Heaven pour down upon him the bitter
Blessings, the Honey Curse, the gilded Pill, that satisfies
Desire, and infects the Mind; give him Riches, and make
him love them, then will he be abhorred of Men, the Spirits,
the Angels, and the Gods: may a proud Sign appear
in his Face, that he may be a Tavern for Devils to riot and
banquet in; let him pamper Nature, feed high, to destroy
his Taste; so blind all the Beauties of the Mind; then will
his hungry Pleasure devour up all the eternal Treasure of
his Soul.

<i>Theor.</i> <i>Godelmo</i>, let thy Passion cease.

<i>Dolo.</i> O pardon me, I must be alone, and burst my Heart
with sighing.      [<i>Ex.</i> Dolo.

<i>Theor.</i> O that Heaven would erect an Altar where Man
might sacrifice himself an Offering; then surely the Blood
of great Men would dye the Spring, the Rivers, and the
Seas. O my Soul is full of Calamity, and my Heart is sore
with Sorrow.

the solemn Gloom, the Noon of Night; my wakeful Soul
can find no rest, but from a jealous Dream I start, I rise amazed,
in the Face of the Elements, bow, sigh, and think
of Sorrow; I wonder what the Moon thinks of me. Oh
when, oh when, shall Time and Sorrow cease! Surely <i>Cupid</i>’s
Dart is the Sting of Death; oh dear Death, oh how I

<i>Sem.</i> Who can sleep when a Lover’s false! This Morning
<i>Cademore</i> intreated for the Life of the King; and as she
kneel’d before <i>Darony</i>, her Sighs, her Tears, her Beauty
has made him passionately in Love with her; yet chear up
thy self, and still have hopes; when a Woman has a mind
to gain a Man, she may study his Constitution, and what
he likes.

<i>Ser.</i> Oh <i>Sementory</i>, I have had cruel Dreams.

<i>Enter</i> Hurlothrumbo.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Ladies, what are you upon now?

<i>Sem.</i> Dreams my Lord.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Can you interpret, Madam?

<i>Sem.</i> You’re sure of my best Endeavours, my Lord.

<i>Hurlo.</i> As I was alone in my Chair, I slumber’d, I thought
myself mounted before a beautiful Wife upon the solemn
Desarts of <i>Arabia</i>, where a dark, black Cloud overwhelm’d
the Desart; a stormy, tempestuous Wind arose, and ripped
up ragged Rocks, then drove them furiously over the
Plain, like tremendous Bullets of Thunder; and all the
dreadful Engines of eternal Misery rose up in Arms; I was
in a Moment surrounded with wild Monsters, fighting with
one another which should devour me first; my Horse tired,
my Wife fell in Labour, the Element opened her fiery
Mouth, and pour’d out Cataracts of Lightning and Hail;
all the Pile of Building in the other World was tumbling
down upon my Head, and how I came into my Body, I
know not.

<i>Sem.</i> You’re happy you had a Body to shelter you: this
prognosticates you’ll endure great Calamities, and at the
last lose your Mistress.
-----File: 035.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Hurlo.</i> This is my Mistress; <i>Darony</i>, my Rival, is dead
in Love to thee; since he’s cruel and inconstant, pour out
thy Grief in merry Sounds; you must part.

<i>Ser.</i> Part, and never meet no more:

/*
How can I bear to see that gloomy Day,
No, no, no, no, I’ll be a Soul, and fly away,
In merry Sounds, I will pour out my Pain,
And never think of Man again.
*/

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> Sem. <i>and</i> Ser.
*/

<i>Enter</i> Primo.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Honest Solitary, what brings thee to Court to-day?

<i>Primo.</i> I am come in hopes to see our Lord and Master
<i>Darony</i>.

<i>Hurlo.</i> He will be here instantly, and desires you will be
Counsel to him, as you was to <i>Soarethereal</i>.

<i>Primo.</i> When he is King, I will be his Subject; till
then, I am fervently so to my Soveraign.

<i>Enter</i> Darony.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Much Joy to your Majesty; I perceive Heaven’s
Frowns are departed from your Dominions: what an Alteration
in the Elements! and all Nature seems to rejoice;
<i>Phœbus</i> till now hath ceas’d to shine upon the foggy Globe
for many Weeks.

<i>Dar.</i> This Morning I perceiv’d the bright Angel in the
Sun, that water and warms this lower World, drive away
swiftly the Clouds from his Presence; he open’d high the
Casement of Heaven, and sweetly smiled upon me.

<i>Hurlo.</i> <i>Primo</i>, what thinkest thou of that?

<i>Primo.</i> When I gaze upon the Sun, I sink into myself,
full of Humility; I also learn Lowliness of the Moon;
when she looks over the Brow, and begins to rise, she’s
huge and dull; she swells like an outstretch’d Hero; but
as she climbs, she clears, she soars aloft diminutive, that she
may shine among the Stars.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Mr. Humility, your humble Servant.
-----File: 036.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Primo.</i> Every one that petitions must be humble, or else
his Petition will not be granted.

<i>Dar.</i> Art thou a Petitioner?

<i>Primo.</i> In the Name of <i>Soarethereal</i> I am, who fervently
desires the Life of <i>Theorbeo</i>.

<i>Dar.</i> He shall not perish by the Hands of Man; but I
have sworn a mighty Thirst of Revenge; he shall take his
Chance in the Room of burning Glass: be thou humble
still, and petition Heaven; cry aloud in Vocal Perspiration
of thy Soul; thy Words, like Thunder, sound in the Elements,
and alarm the Angels on high; then if thou hast
Power above, let <i>Phœbus</i> cease to shine, or <i>Theorbeo</i> cease
to live.

<i>Primo.</i> Then he must not live.

<i>Dar.</i> No, he shall not live.

<i>Primo.</i> Oh how Men condemn themselves!

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> Primo.
*/

<i>Dar.</i> Compassion is a Weakness in Man, it may become
a Woman; not but I feel the Failing in myself, tho’ I
conquer it and keep it under, lest it should appear to the
World.

<i>Hurlo.</i> That’s true, my Lord.

<i>Dar.</i> I am inform’d <i>Soarethereal</i> is in a Wood with 20000
Men, and designs to conquer there or die; and I myself
will be there present at the Slaughter.

<i>Hurlo.</i> There is no danger of him, my Lord; he is surrounded
with 60000 Men, and was he a Grashopper, he
could not escape your Armour.

<i>Dar.</i> Then I’m at peace within; yet <i>Cademore</i> still runs
in my Mind: let us haste to her Apartment, and if she
will not consent to marry, I’ll force her.      [<i>Exeunt.</i>
-----File: 037.png---------------------------------------------------------


<g>SCENE</g>, <i>a Prison</i>.

<i>Enter</i> Theorbeo, <i>and</i> Dologodelmo <i>looking on his Watch</i>.

<i>Theor.</i> Our Time is almost expired.

<i>Dolo.</i> I think this Finger is like the Dart of Death, upon
the Figure of Twelve sits my Life; Oh how it steals to
sting!

<i>Theor.</i> Those are melancholly Thoughts, think not of
Death, but of Life, or of any thing that will divert thee
most.

<i>Dolo.</i> When I think my King is in misery, and <i>Darony</i>
upon his Throne; when the Noble suffer, and Miscreants
are blest, then my Faculties within me rejoice; there is a
secret Thought in that, which revives my very Soul.

<i>Theor.</i> A small Offence unthrones the Noble, but infamous
Actions raise a Tyrant.

<i>Enter Guards and Executioner.</i>

<i>Theor.</i> After what manner must we suffer?

<i>Dolo.</i> In the Room of burning glass.

<i>Theor.</i> Then what means this Executioner?

<i>Dolo.</i> If the Sun destroys us not, as he rides along the
Meridian Course, by this Man we must be slaughtered.

<i>Offic.</i> My Lord, your Time’s expired; Guards attend
here.

<i>Enter</i> Flame.

<i>Fla.</i> But hold, I’m come to give you a Description of
your happy Flight to the <i>Elysian</i>: Your Neck’s no sooner
laid to the Block, but the Stroke’s given; immediately your
Soul begins a March through all the Elements: in the Body
first, you’re confin’d five Minutes in the Regions of Fire,
amazed, amidst the verdant green Climes of Water and
Air; you pass then heavily through the solemn Gloom of
-----File: 038.png---------------------------------------------------------
Earth; you go, you faint, the Soul bows, farewel to Nature;
you fall into a dark, black Slumber, a Trance; and
when the Spirit touches you upon the Elbow, you wake
surpriz’d in a World of Light; there you see <i>Shakespear</i>,
<i>Milton</i>, <i>Homer</i>, sprightly, alert, alive, flying swiftly through
the radiant Climes, to visit the Wits of every Generation;
the Rich, Poor, the Merry, Mournful; the pamper’d, hungry
Souls are there. Alas, the Scene is chang’d, you’ll not
pity them; Queen <i>Eliz.</i> is in her Hut, selling of fry’d Fritters;
<i>Pompey</i> and <i>Alexander</i> carry Charcoal to feed her
Fires; the Great Mogul, the Czar, the grim Bashaw, the
Emperor, the Grand Turk and <i>Cæsar</i>, are scrambling for
the Drops of the Pan, and as they are wont, are scuffling
for Trifles, till it raises their inextinguishable Rage to Loggerheads,
cutting, flashing, carbonading <i>Nero</i>’s Buttocks;
nay, they’re all fighting in Blood up to the Ears, and there
is the Devil to do amongst them.

/*
[<i>Exit</i> Flame.
*/

<i>Theo. Dologodelmo</i> farewell.

<i>Dolo.</i> Our Time is come to part.

<i>Theo.</i> Farewell, my Lord farewell, this World is all Departure;
Oh that I could appoint a Place to meet thee
after Death; yet through the ranging of my Soul at Liberty,
I’ll surely ken thee afar; methinks I see thee shine
upon the brightest Mountain in the highest Orb, stretching
forth thy self, and pluming thy immortal Wings, preparing
to take thy everlasting and eternal Flight; and when
we meet to part no more, may all our Song be Love, in
Divine Tranquility.

<i>Dolo.</i> This lofty, sublime Speculation, proceeds from
your own Virtue, not from my Merit; for if the Work
of this Life, makes a Garment for the Soul, mine will be
stain’d with Avarice, Debauchery and Revenge; you are
Innocent: O Innocence! thou only Traveller to Heaven,
farewell for ever.      [<i>Ex.</i>

<g>SCENE</g>, <i>a Wood</i>.

<i>Thunder and Lightning. Enter</i> King.

<i>King.</i> What a Smell of Sulphur is here? Was ever Day
like this? surely all the Infernals are rising up in Arms,
in Thunder, Lightning, and Hail; the Air’s in a Flame; I
think my self in the Sun, expecting every Moment to be
dissolv’d, and Conscience smiles.

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> King.

<i>A</i> Genius <i>descends in a Cloud, and</i> Death <i>enters upon a
pale-dun Horse</i>.

<i>Death.</i> Thou Genius of the King, confront me not.

<i>Genius.</i> Oh Death, thou long-liv’d Mortal, say for what
art thou come, thus proudly aloft, and hieroglyphick mounted?

<i>Death.</i> To Wars, Victory, Revenge, with Stings from
<i>Lucifer</i> my imperial Grandfather; I drive my Parent Man
from Nature; I’ll die, be born again, and pursue him in
Eternity.

<i>Genius.</i> Thus when Man commits a Crime, he creates a
Fiend to fight against him: remember thou Toad of Hell,
all the Elements that compound the Nature of Mortals,
are now conspiring against thee.

<i>Death.</i> Discord horrid!

<i>Genius.</i> Thou Off-spring of Sin, that is, of that Nature
that will draw upon it all the eternal Vengeance of
Heaven!

<i>Death.</i> Thou mak’st me tremble.

<i>Genius.</i> Tremble thou, when yon marble Sky shall rent,
flashing swift as the Lightning glimpse away; when crimson
Elements appear, and Fury rides on flaming Winds,
and spreads himself abroad, deep in the Bowels of this
Globe shall wake, nay twice ten thousand Thunders, renting
the rocky Mountains, and hurling Kingdoms to the

Sky; Cataracts of Fire, and purple Storms shall rage, and
hurricane thy infernal Soul.

<i>Death.</i> Discord horrid!      [<i>Ex.</i> Death.

<i>Enter</i> King.

<i>King.</i> Man, what is thy Business here to interrupt my
Solitude?

<i>Genius.</i> I follow the Oppress’d, where I often find Relief.

<i>King.</i> What is thy Name?

<i>Genius.</i> My Name is secret, I was Tutor to a young
Man, and when I corrected him to cure Pride, he resisted
and rose up against me, and for that Reason I have left
him for a Season.

<i>King.</i> And will Calamity cure Pride?

<i>Genius.</i> Behold yon pamper’d high-fed Colt, unoppress’d,
at ease, unbroke, he leap’d his Mounds, and sported all abroad;
he saw a Lamb, a Nightingale, a Dove; he started,
snorted, and bridled with Disdain, with twisted Neck
and cocking Tail, with bended Knee he bounds away, disdaining
all he sees; but now his Back is stain’d with Saddle-marks,
his Mouth is gaul’d with Bridle-bit; and he that
despis’d the Lamb, the Dove, the Nightingale before,
now is tam’d, and feeding with a Goose and Boar.

<i>King.</i> Alas! I pity thee; here is all the Money I have,
and this Ring; ’twas given me by one I most admire.

<i>Genius.</i> But why do you give me all?

<i>King.</i> I am distress’d my self, and design to ask Relief
of Heaven.

<i>Genius.</i> I will speak of thy Generosity, and force my
Words to the highest Heaven; Angels will love and long
for thy coming on high; rapp’d with thy Fame will wing
away, warbling as the Swift, to meet thee in thy flight.

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> Genius.

the Spheres, and heavenly Song, penetrate the Sky, and
eccho in my Soul.

greatly rejoice: <i>Lomporhomock</i> and <i>Hurlothrumbo</i> are come
down with an Army of 60000 Men, and threaten in a Moment
to destroy you and your Troops.      [<i>Ex.</i> Officer.

<i>King.</i> The excessive Storm blows up the Fire of my Soul,
and makes me long to fight; every String of my Heart is
firm, is stony as the Lion’s Nerve; it rises in my Breast,
it leaps, it yearns; Oh great is my Desire! I am all athirst,
not for the Blood of my Adversaries, but for the
Freedom of my Friends.

be interr’d under his Statue in the Grove, that if you ever
come to your Kingdom, you may sometimes walk and
think of him.      [<i>Exit</i> Officer.

but yet with me indeed it is. Oh when shall the End of
all Things come! When shall the Musick of the Spheres
break out! like Trumpets found Alarms, and Thunder in
Bases roar? Oh when shall the glittering Crouds of Angels
tread the Stages of the Sky, to sing the Chorus at the End
of Time! Sing, oh Chant, with Sounds to metamorphose
Man; and make me, oh make me any thing but what I
am!

<i>King.</i> Why do you pause?

<i>Offic.</i> I fear to speak.

<i>King.</i> Speak, for I dread not to hear; this Moment I
will fight and die with my Army.

every thing that’s dear to me in Life, my Crown, my Mistress,

and my Friends? Rise up now, thou Strength of
Reason, and pull down the Passion of my Soul; oh let the
Curtain of the Clouds be lifted up, the Scenes, the Elements
depart asunder; and may some piercing penetrating
Eye in tender Pity gaze upon me!

either fight or die, and only wait for your Majesty’s Commands.

Yet hold, 20000 to engage with 60000, there must be great
Courage or Contrivance, tho’ I have known brave Men naked
have beaten Cowards in Armour; I have also heard of
the <i>Grecian</i> Contrivance, their Horse: I scorn to overcome
by Stratagem, no, I’ll raise up the Spirit of my Army; I’ll
give them to drink Brandy mix’d with Gun-powder, and in
the Anguish and Bitterness of my Soul, I’ll slash it through
the Veins, and mingle it in the Blood of every Man, that
they altogether may be one in the Image of a Dragon.

/*
With fiery Heart and flaming Eyes,
To every Part the Sulphur flies;
The Wings extend, the thorny Points display,
The Sting from Mouth ascends, and shuts for happy Day:
The Heart, the Eyes, the Sting, the Feet, the furious Claws,
Mount all up on the Wing, and fly amidst the Foes;
Then Lightning from the Nostrils flies.
Swift Thunder-bolts from Anus, and the Mouth will break,
With Sounds to pierce the Skies, and make the Earth to quake:
And if one Part should chance to fail,
I’ll prick him on with speary Tail.

and mounts my Body Upon the Wing; flies through the
Woods, rips up the lofty Oaks, splits the Rocks, plows up
the Seas. Oh this scandalizing World! disgrace the noble
<i>Oliver</i>, and say, that he is Gunpowder-maker to the Devil;
and that <i>Lucifer</i> reads the Scriptures, that he may plead against
Mortals. See, see those two glow-worms how they
glitter; these are <i>Cleopatra</i>’s radiant Eyes, just scrall’d up
from her Body, ambitious to vie against the Stars: How
vain is Woman! veil thy Bosom, those heaving Monsters
fire me; oh that I was a Child again, that I might suck!

<i>Cad.</i> I pity this poor unfortunate Man, I feel his Distemper
approach my Brain.

<i>Daro.</i> Dear Lady fly me not, stay and hear me speak;
<i>Ovid</i>’s Words in <i>Bonon</i>’s Sound, cannot describe the Passion
of my Love.

<i>Cad.</i> Cruel Man, follow me not; if you love me, do not
augment my Torment.

<i>Daro.</i> I am come with Comforts to feed the distressed
Soul, I love.

<i>Cad.</i> What in me, do you admire?

<i>Daro.</i> Your Person, Madam.

<i>Cad.</i> They are Brutes that marry Bodies; the Mind is all
that can be loved; the other is a Desire proceeds from

Nature vicious, urged by Food and Wine: Live low, and
you’ll not love me.

ask for more?

/*

of <i>Darony</i>, with which I’ll spear the Heart of <i>Seringo</i>, that
Weather-cock; I’ll raise it upon some Pinacle or Spire; it
shall ever whirl about with every Blast; myself I’ll dissolve
into Air; I’ll make the stormy Winds to blow, the petty
Breezes shall have no Power; but I’ll reign King of Tempest.

<i>Hurlo.</i> My Lord, can I serve you? Do you please to accept
of Assistance?

<i>Flame. Hurlothrumbo</i>, what hast thou done with <i>Seringo</i>,
hid her in thy Belly? Speak, in a moment speak, or I’ll rip
it open, and let her out.

answer you!

Fire and Gunpowder, I’ll blow thy Limbs and Stings to every
Part of the Globe!

may answer him in his own Language! [<i>Aside.</i>] If you
please to let us go, my Lord, we’ll this Moment mount her
upon the Back of the Sun; in the mean while, you get a
stradling upon the Moon, there you’ll be mounted aloft,
and ride after her, spur and whip, whip and spur, and you’ll
be sure to overtake her in the Eclipses; there you’ll be
clapp’d together, Face to Face, one upon another; and all
the World will shout and say, he has her, he has her, he
has her! huzza!

on with Thunder.

Security.

<i>Cad.</i> My Lord, you seem to be in Distress, is it in my
Power to assist you?

<i>Fla.</i> No; my Soul, like a Jocky, is mounted and riding
his eternal Race; I have slackned the Reins of Nature, and
the Beast pulls, is pampered with too many Beans and Oats,
and is running away with me to the Devil.

/*
[<i>Exit</i> Flame <i>and</i> Seringo.

<i>Cad.</i> Pity! I have heard of Pity, surely Pity now is banish’d
from the Earth, and all the Spirits of Love are lock’d up fast
in Heaven. Was I once free from this miserable Cave
of Nature, I think I could deny myself even of Paradise, to
fly about within this lower World, to cure all the Sick, and
heal the Broken-hearted: If there be a Maid on Earth
whose Grief is like to mine, O ye sublimer Genius of the
Air! in tender Pity direct her here to me, that I may lay
my Face down to her Feet, and wash them clean with
Tears; then will I rise, and gaze, and give her all that’s
mine, that Generosity may please my Soul, and Love will
rise up in my Heart, and conquer all my Grief.

ACT V.


<i>Enter</i> Hurlothrumbo, <i>in Prison guarded</i>.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Leave me alone, let me vent, let me pour out
the inveterate Anguish of my Soul; I see there
is nothing impossible; no, does not this World turn round
without Spit or Jack, and roast before the Fire in the Elements
’till all her Fruits are ripe to eat? If this be so, all
things are rul’d by the same Power, and there is nothing
impossible. Stand still ye Globe, let there be but one Season,
scorch or starve the Universe: Come a little nearer,
oh ye Sun, and burn all mortal Race, or keep thee farther
off, and starve them soon to Death; oh that all Mankind
might perish with myself!

<i>Enter</i> Lomporhomock, <i>guarded</i>.

<i>Hurlo.</i> My Lord <i>Lomporhomock</i>, you’re welcome to your
new Habitation.

<i>Lom.</i> ’Tis a cold Place.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Yes; you had us’d to stew your Lungs up in Claret
all Night, and the next Morning skim the Pot with a
Pipe of Tobacco; but a little cold Water must now suffice:
I wish I had the scourging of thy <i>Dutch</i> Buttocks.

<i>Lom.</i> Is there any Hopes of Liberty?

<i>Hurlo.</i> Nothing more sure than that; they’ll first make
thee dance the stripping Dance.

<i>Lom.</i> How is that?

<i>Hurlo.</i> They’ll first take this Stone Cloak off thy Shoulders;
thy Clothes off thy Back; then strip thy Body of thy
Soul, and send it into its own Country stark naked, and a
good Journey to you.
-----File: 048.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Lom.</i> Rather a good Dream.

<i>Hurlo.</i> This World is all a Dream, an Outside, a Dunghill
pav’d with Diamonds; but to you and your cursed Army
nothing can compare,

/*
Except I hunt the Woods, to find a Savage Boar:
No sooner he his Adversary sees,
But rouses up from Luxury and Ease;
His Heart and Eyes, was in Surprize, and both at Civil War,
And all his Passion backward flies, and flames into the Air,
Then from his Jaws did Foam descend, as tho’ he fear’d no Evil;
The Tail, the Tusks, the Bristles stood an end, as if he’d fight the Devil;
But when with Spear, the Foe drew near, to shout for happy Day,
His Ears let fall, and drooping all, cry’d <i>Boh!</i> and run away.      [<i>Exit</i> Lomp.
*/

<i>Enter</i> Primo.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Honourable Sir, and greatest Comfort in Adversity,
’tis my fervent Desire to know what Pleasure we shall
enjoy in the <i>Elysian</i>; for now all my Hopes are there.

<i>Primo.</i> Has your Pleasure been intellectual, in which the
Body has no share?

<i>Hurlo.</i> I have had very delightful Dreams, all Spirit and
Love; but I must needs say, the Body did share in the
Pleasure, and Woman has been all the Delight of my Life.

<i>Primo.</i> Look up, my Lord; you see yon Marble Sky,
thro’ that is the Way you are to pass; then you come to
a Scarlet Flame, that Flame compounds the Nature of Woman,
and if that Part of Woman has dissolved thee here,
how shalt thou be able to march thro’ the fiery Element, on
which a Woman is made; no, it cannot be, you will
descend, you’ll yearn to your old Delights, and visit the
Virgins in the Night.

<i>Hurlo.</i> That’s good.
-----File: 049.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Primo.</i> Then will you haunt melancholy Tombs, and
visit <i>Hurlothrumbo</i> in his Solitude; invite him to a Banquet
of Raptures: but alas, he’ll be indispos’d, and so desire to
be excus’d.

<i>Hurlo.</i> That’s blank; may I not fly amongst my old
Friends, and noble Officers? will they not honour me as a
Person of Quality?

<i>Primo.</i> Every Man is honour’d according to his Colour
and Brightness; your common Souls are like dissolved Allum,
pour’d in clear Water; these are not able to converse
with the Sublimes, nor Gloworm shine before the
Sun.

<i>Hurlo.</i> I hope they’ll not rob me of my Honour, that
his Majesty has bestow’d upon me: they’ll call me Lord,
will they not?

<i>Primo.</i> Words are not the Language of the Place, ’tis
Musick, Motion, Hieroglyphick, Dress.

<i>Hurlo.</i> Tell me how shall I converse with <i>Brutus</i>, I long
to see him: By what shall I know him?

<i>Primo.</i> <i>Brutus</i> is in Scarlet; his Heart shines like a Star,
and his Right hand is black.

<i>Hurlo.</i> What, for Murder! then I shall be black all over;
now be sincere, and let me know your Opinion of my
Case.

<i>Primo.</i> Then answer me, can you love a Friend more
than a Mistress?

<i>Hurlo.</i> No.

<i>Primo.</i> Are you mov’d with Sounds? do they drive Venom
from your Soul, and make your Blood run cold?

<i>Hurlo.</i> No.

<i>Primo.</i> Are you affected with sublime Prose; do your
Nerves creep, and your Veins shiver?

<i>Hurlo.</i> No.

<i>Primo.</i> Then you’ll enter into the Shades like a Cow in
an Opera, terrify’d with Delights; she lows and interrupts;
she gallops to those Climes, where is most Grass, and a
Bull.      [<i>Ex.</i> Primo.

<i>Hurlo.</i> May be live in my Dream, upon the Desarts of
<i>Arabia</i>, hurl’d about with stormy Tempest, in Thunder,
Lightning and Hail; be pursued by Dragons, Wolves and
Tygers; then fly to my Body for shelter, and find the Door
-----File: 050.png---------------------------------------------------------
shut. Oh most horrid! oh, what has brought me to this
unhappy Place of Misery? it was in pursuit of Honour.

/*
Honour, like the lighted Meteor in the Air,
She leads the midnight Traveller astray,
Forsaken by the Light, the Sun and Day;
Thro’ Brambles, Briers, Hedges, Ditches,
The <i>Ignis fatuus</i> the Fool bewitches.
Thus stimulated, the glimmering Light deceives him,
Leads him to a miry Bog, then vanishes and leaves him:
Thus I do roul and wallow in the Mire of the Mind,
Not one Moment’s Ease to my Soul can find;
Shine oh Sun, my Life to me restore,
And thee for <i>Fatuus</i> I’ll forsake no more.

[<i>Ex.</i> Hurlo.

<i>Enter</i> King, <i>and Officer</i>.

<i>King.</i> Here I parted with <i>Theorbeo</i>; ah he is gone, he is
banish’d from the Earth; oh now my Body hungers for the
Ground, as my Soul is a-thirst for Heaven; I will go visit
him in the Dust, whilst Sorrow is desirous to vent, lest I
rejoice at the Sight of <i>Cademore</i>, and forget my Grief for
my Friend. The Fatigue of this Day has been very great;
what can strengthen these trembling Nerves; quench and
compose these flaming Spirits?

<i>Offic.</i> Sleep.

<i>King.</i> Oh, what can make an afflicted Mind to sleep?

<i>Offic.</i> Harmony.

<i>King.</i> ’Tis true; whilst I visit <i>Theorbeo</i>, get the Performers
in readiness; let the Musick be <i>Astartus</i>, ’tis the Language
of Angels, the Eccho of Heaven; and who shall declare
the Sense to Mortals? Those Sounds inspire the Intellect,
and strengthen the Soul; they animate and arm the
Mind; raise to the highest Œconomy of the Universe, and
lure me quite from Care; then finely turning the Keys of
Paradise, they waft me from Orb to Orb, and make me,
thro’ divine Opticks, see, the radiant Splendors of bright
shining Worlds.

[<i>Musick plays solemn. The Scene discovers</i> Theorbeo<i>’s
Statue in a Grove</i>.

<i>Enter</i> King.

<i>King.</i> I could lay me down, and dissolve my Body by
thee, and make my Soul to swim away to thine in Floods
of Tears: Oh <i>Theorbeo</i>, thy Body was inhabited once by
all things fine, Faculties that rous’d aloft within, ready to
heave up the Sky, and force themselves to Heaven; full of
an humble Grandeur, Resolution, Ambition divine, that
mighty he, that wings the Soul: ’tis impossible that so
much Greatness should ever cease to live; oh here let me
stay, till thy Breath of eternal Raptures, shall descend from
Heaven in Harmony; when thy bright Spirit, like the Sun,
shall glance from the Sphere, I’ll leap up in Extasy, and
meet thee in the Air; when we descend, I’ll stand to pause,
to gaze, admire, rejoyce and weep; I’ll parry thy Beams,
run into thy Rays, and clasp thee in my Arms; if I become
blind; but now sleepy Nature calls to rest, and as
our Bodies slumbering sympathize, may our Souls in extatick
Visions meet.

/*
[<i>Enter</i> Seringo <i>and sings, and Exit</i>.
*/

<i>Enter</i> Theorbeo <i>and</i> Dologodelmo.

<i>Theor.</i> She resembles the Guardian Angel of a Man,
when his Pupil to <i>Pluto</i> and to Vice is given; then just
like her, he sings, he mourns, and sends the Muse to Heaven.

<i>King.</i> Now have I pass’d my <i>Cademore</i>’s World, and enter
<i>Theorbeo</i>’s Kingdom; is it thus we pass from lasting
Sleep, and wak’d to Life by a Choir of Angels? This inimitable
Sound makes all my Nerves to creep; the chanting
Harmony thrills my Veins; the superlative Sweetness of
the Musick raises me from the Dust of Death.

/*
[<i>He rises and sees</i> Theorbeo.
*/

Oh <i>Theorbeo</i>, I am like a Cœlestial inspired Man, my Heart
is full of Love, and overflows with Joy; is it lasting, or
-----File: 052.png---------------------------------------------------------
will it vanish? To-day or ever? Momentary or eternal?
declare those blooming Thoughts; a Pearl and Heavenly
Mystery lodge within thy Eyes, ripe with Anity, appris’d
with Tidings from on high; oh tell to me the Case of separate
Souls; or in the Rapidity of thy Career, catch me
away in a divine Transport, I long to touch thee; may I
touch thee?

<i>Theor.</i> Yes, you may.

<i>Dolo.</i> Will your Majesty give me leave to explain the
Mystery?

<i>King.</i> Speak <i>Godelmo</i>, for I long to hear.

<i>Dolo.</i> The King was no sooner enter’d the Room of
Burning-Glass; but it scorch’d his very Soul; crying out aloud
to Heaven, with fervent Oraison, the Sun seem’d to
start, and vail’d his Face with Clouds; for when he reflected
on what was done, he mourn’d and wept, he wetted
all the World with Tears: when we were both releas’d
from our Chains, he drew the Vesture from his Eyes, and
smil’d on all the Earth.

<i>King.</i> Oh <i>Theorbeo</i>, methinks I see the Angel, that pitches
his Pavilion round thee, leave thee and march to the higher
Regions of the Air, then rise up with his glittering Glory,
and eclipse the Sun; O <i>Theorbeo</i>, I celebrate a Dunelmo in
my Heart, and all the Faculties of my Soul are banqueting
on high Delight.

<i>Enter</i> Flame.

<i>Fla.</i> The Centry of my Actions is just reliev’d; my new
Companion, and a good Conscience, revive my Vitals,
chuck my Heart under the Chin; and all the Strings strike
up a Rit-a-te; every Faculty is trickling down with Transports.

/*
<i>Sings.</i> I gaze in Transport charm’d,
         My Soul’s with Love alarm’d.

<g><i>A SONG.</i></g>

<i>Scene changes to the Court.</i>

<i>Enter</i> Sementory <i>and</i> Seringo.

<i>Sem.</i> See here comes the King; Calamity prepares a Man
to receive a Petition; <i>Dolo</i> will tell him the Cause of our
coming.
-----File: 053.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Enter</i> Dologodelmo.

<i>Dolo.</i> I have inform’d the King that you have a Petition
to his Majesty; he’ll instantly pass by, and speak to you;
see where he comes!      [<i>Ex.</i> Dolo.

<i>Enter</i> King.

<i>Sem.</i> Pray my Sovereign Lord hear us, let Pity move;
the meanest of Kings pardon small Offences, and the mightiest
of Kings may stand in need of Mercy; your Majesty
knows that Greatness is seen more in a Man, when Mercy
exerts in Lowliness, than when he rides in Fury, upon red-wing’d
Thunder to revenge.

<i>King.</i> Rise up, I’ll hear no more, I can guess at what
you’ll say. (<i>Ex.</i> Sem. <i>and</i> Ser.) My Enemies are the Rod of
Heaven, that seldom ceases to torment: How mean a thing
it is for Men to beg that Life, that is in the Hands of the
greatest Adversary? No, they cannot live, their Breath
would infect the Air, who would turn loose Dragons, Wolves
and Tygers, I am not safe upon my Throne; yet Wisdom,
in the highest Philosophy, tells me I am fate? for if there
be a Power above, I am the Shadow of that Power below;
and if so, not all the Power of my Adversaries, and all the
furious Infernals, can stir a Shadow the Breadth of a Hair,
except they have power to move the Substance. I cannot
bear to have an Enemy; if I destroy these Men, they go
down to the Dust unconquered: I never knew a Temper,
not of the most inveterate kind, but I could conquer it, and
force the Man to love me. When Ambition, Revenge and
Passions rise, then Reason strengthens, and Love stands up
and demands a Parly; and when my vanquish’d Adversary
stands before me, it is equal to me whether I strike or kiss.

/*
[<i>Exit.</i>
*/

<i>Enter</i> Sementory <i>and</i> Seringo.

<i>Sem.</i> <i>Darony</i> is very desirous to live, he’s much in love
with Life; the King is now in <i>Cademore</i>’s Apartment; she
may soften his Mind, and make him full of Compassion:
-----File: 054.png---------------------------------------------------------
<i>Darony</i> deserves no Pity. Oh <i>Seringo</i>, what was you in love
with, when you admir’d that Mortal?

<i>Ser.</i> Not with the Man, but his Title.

<i>Sem.</i> Well, we Women are not worth a wise Man’s Observation;
our graceless Pride, and covetous Ambition, makes
us always poor, and tasteless; were we humble as the purest
Spirits, discerning as the Watchers above; we should admire
Merit, then find Happiness, and be as rich as Hermits:
you’ll never prosper for your Cruelty to the Lord <i>Flame</i>.

<i>Ser.</i> That’s my fear.

<i>Sem.</i> See, here he comes; ’tis Vertue creates Love, Love
Fire, and Fire confin’d creates Madness; but give vent, and
all shall be well.

<i>Ser.</i> I will, <i>Sementory</i>.

<i>Enter</i> Flame.

<i>Fla.</i> What! not marry’d yet?

<i>Sem.</i> No; Angels are jealous of the Sublime in Ladies,
prevent and preserve us from rude Men; for they destroy
the Beauty of the Mind, as Time and Thought do the Body.

<i>Fla.</i> O <i>Seringo</i>! that thy Heart was Steel; ’tis Sand
upon which I wrote all my Perfections, but every little
Wind makes an Alteration, and blows the Impression quite
away.

<i>Sem.</i> Make way; see here the King comes!

/*
[<i>Ex.</i> Flame, Sementory, <i>and</i> Seringo.
*/

<i>Enter</i> King <i>and</i> Cademore.

<i>Cad.</i> Oh! tell me, how did you bear the Pangs of Parting?

<i>King.</i> When I heard that you was married to another
my Soul sigh’d within me; it mourn’d, it griev’d, I perceiv’d
a Tear of Blood to trickle down, and drop from the Bottom
of my Heart; then Reason rouz’d within me, with celestial
Wings I soar’d, I flew to my Aid aloft, I sigh’d, I
bow’d sublime, and wept.
-----File: 055.png---------------------------------------------------------

<i>Enter</i> Theorbeo <i>and</i> Dologodelmo.

<i>Dolo.</i> The vanquish’d Traitors are come to appear before
your Majesty.

<i>King.</i> Can you bear to see any thing in distress?

<i>Theo.</i> I must own my Soul is apt to sympathize.

<i>King.</i> ’Tis so with me; when I see the Wound of a Man,
that Part of me trembles; and thro’ viewing a Cripple, have
been seiz’d with Lameness. How Thoughts rise up and
plead to strengthen Mercy! telling me I am a Judge, my
own Eternal highly honour’d, myself appears before myself,
to receive from myself my irrevocable Sentence.

<i>A Shout behind the Scenes. Enter</i> Hurlothrumbo, Urlandenny,
<i>and</i> Darony.

<i>King.</i> Here comes <i>Hurlothrumbo</i> in Hieroglyphicks; pray
the meaning of this comical Dress?

<i>Hurlo.</i> ’Tis a dumb Confession of my Guilt, ’tis an Index
to my Heart; black and yellow without, wild and foolish
within.

<i>King.</i> ’Tis true; though I have never known a Coward
honourable, I have seen a stout Man a Villain; the Love
of Gold will overthrow the greatest Heart: thou hast conquer’d
a Lion, deceiv’d a Madman, and cunningly escaped
from Death, but now——

<i>Hurlo.</i> Oh now let me live that I may be all divine, and
so out-wit the Devil!

<i>King.</i> <i>Darony</i>, what have you to ask?

<i>Dar.</i> Life, and Pardon for my Offences.

<i>King.</i> As the Optick through the Lid discerns the Light;
so through the Eye of the Intellect, methinks I see your separate
Souls strolling sad through the intricate Windings of
<i>Elysium</i>: I pity you all as poor unfortunate Men; <i>Darony</i>,
I will not take from you that Life which Heaven has given,
but will give thee Riches to satisfy the Thirst of thy Ambition.
Why do you pause?

<i>Dar.</i> Oh what an Alteration in the Mind! your Generosity
is at Wars within, and knocks down Avarice, Cruelty
and Pride in me, I am in love with your Greatness, and
-----File: 056.png---------------------------------------------------------
hate myself; I myself will punish your Offender, [<i>stabs
himself</i>] Oh! loose me, ’tis not finished.      [Dol. <i>holds him</i>.

<i>King.</i> See, is the Wound mortal?

<i>Dol.</i> ’Tis not, my Lord.

<i>King.</i> Unarm him, take him hence, he shall not die. <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>,
so long as thou art cloathed in that like Garment,
thou shalt live, thou shalt never appear in Scarlet any more,
to deceive Mankind. <i>Urlandenny</i>, I remember what good
thy Father perform’d in our Family, therefore I will not separate
thy Soul from thy Body, but will give thee Liberty.

<i>Urlan.</i> Oh how Heaven exerts in Nature! Great and noble
Man, every Tongue shall speak of thee, their Words
shall mingle with the Winds, to fly and sing through all and
every part: those Sounds rebound from Sky to Sky, and
Eccho’s ring in every Heart; and when that Cloud thy Body
shall pass from the Sun, thy Soul, that Sun, shall shine throughout
all Worlds: the diminutive Spirits will in Amazement
stand, for thy exceeding Glory will eclipse their Sight: Fear
and Trembling on their vital Hearts will seize, they’ll drop
to the Earth as Leaves in Autumn fall; the mortal Stars will
not presume to gaze, but in thy Presence veil their Faces
all.      [<i>Exeunt.</i>

EPILOGUE,

BY

Mr. <i><g>BYROM</g></i>.


Enter <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>.

/*
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, my Lord of</i> Flame
<i>Has sent me here to thank you in his Name;
Proud of your Smiles, he’s mounted many a Story
Above the tip-top Pinnacle of Glory:
Thence he defies the Sons of Clay, the Criticks;
Fellows, says he, that are meer Paralyticks,
With Judgments lame, and Intellects that halt,
Because a Man outruns them——they find fault.
He is indeed, to speak my poor Opinion,
Out of the reach of</i> critical <i>Dominion.</i>
