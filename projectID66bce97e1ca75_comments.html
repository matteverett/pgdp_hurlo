<p>... every book ought to be read with the same spirit and in the same manner as it is writ. Thus the famous author of <em>Hurlothrumbo</em> told a learned bishop, that the reason his lordship could not taste the excellence of his piece was, that he did not read it with a fiddle in his hand; which instrument he himself had always had in his own, when he composed it.</p>

<p>The page numbering in this book skips from 28 to 33, but no material is missing (confirmed by reference to other editions) - it appears to be a printing error.</p>
<h2>Proofing</h2>
<p>This is an 18th-century book that uses the long s (ſ), which looks a lot like an f. Please proof as a <strong>regular s</strong> (i.e., proof "progreſs" as "progress"). See the <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofing_old_texts">Proofing old texts</a> page for more information.</p>
<p>Please also make sure you <strong>remove</strong> the <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofreading_Guidelines#Single_Word_at_Bottom_of_Page">catch-words</a> at the bottom of pages, even if they're the second part of a hyphenated word.</p></BODY></HTML>
