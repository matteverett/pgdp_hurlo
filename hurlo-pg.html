      When I think of your Goodness, it gives me Encouragement to put my
      Play under your grand Protection; and if you can find any thing in it
      worthy of your Praise, I am sure the <i>Super-Naturals</i> will like
      it. I do not flatter when I say, your Taste is universal, Great as an
      Empress, Sweet and Refin’d as Lady <i>Malpas</i>, Sublime as Lady
      <i>Sarah Cowper</i>, Learned and Compleat as Lady <i>Conway</i>,
      Distinguishing and Clear as Mrs. <i>Madin</i>, Gay, Good and Innocent
      as Lady <i>Bland</i>. I have often thought that you are a Compound of
      the World’s Favourites, that all meet and rejoice together in one; the
      Taste of <i>Montagu</i>, <i>Wharton</i>,
      <span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>or <i>Meredith</i>,
      <i>Stanhope</i>, <i>Sneid</i>, or <i>Byrom</i>; the Integrity and
      Hospitality of <i>Legh</i> of <i>Lime</i>, the Wit and Fire of
      <i>Bunbury</i>, the Sense of an <i>Egerton</i>, fervent to serve as
      <i>Beresford</i> or <i>Mildmay</i>, belov’d like <i>Gower</i>. If you
      was his Rival, you’d weaken the Strength of that most powerful
      Subject. I hope your eternal Unisons in Heaven will always sing to
      keep up the Harmony in your Soul, that is Musical as Mrs.
      <i>Leigh</i>, and never ceases to delight; raises us in Raptures like
      <i lang='it'>Amante Sposa</i>, Lord <i>Essex</i>, or the Sun. If every Pore in
      every Body in <i>Cheshire</i> was a Mouth they would all cry out
      aloud, <i>God save the Lady</i> DELVES! that illuminates the Minds, of
      Mortals, inspires with Musick and Poetry especially,

      I Return Thanks to Heaven, which is in you, I mean your Taste, that
      would not continue, except it was cherish’d with Vertue, that Parent
      of Eternal Love; ’tis all Palate hungers after, intellectual Food,
      Generosity, Harmony; the lofty Lines of a sublime Pen: and these
      beautiful Perfections in you, have been the Chief Support of my Play.
      At this Time there are as many fine Poets in <i>England</i> as ever
      there were; but they will not write, because they say there is nothing
      encourag’d but Noise and Nonsense. But I believe those Bards are
      mistaken; for so long as the Lord Duke of
      <span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span><i>Montagu</i>,
      Yourself, and Mr. <i>Charles Stanhope</i> live, fine Poetry will not
      want Encouragement: tho’ I have nothing to boast of in my Play, but
      the Character of <i>Soarethereal</i>, yet you great Men, that shine
      among the Angels, did condescend to support me; and no one is more
      thankful than

      <i>Hurlo.</i> Say! he says and he says not, cares and he cares not,
      he’s King and he’s no King; his high-born Soul is above the Sublunary
      World, he reigns, he rides in the Clouds, and keeps his Court in the
      Horizon; He’s Emperor of the superlative Heights, and lives in
      Pleasure among the Gods; he plays at Bowls with the Stars, and makes a
      Foot-ball of the Globe; he makes that to fly far, far out of the reach
      of Thought.

      the stifled Fire appears, then <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Mars</i>, the King,
      will rise with all the Gods to keep the Rebels under: They’ll make

    <p>
      <i>Sem.</i> ’Tis Love, all Love; in his Travels he came to the Court
      of <i>Spain</i>, where he fell in Love with <i>Cademore</i>, the
      King’s most beautiful Daughter; and <i>Theorbeo</i>, her elder
      Brother, is link’d in Friendship with <i>Soarethereal</i>. The King of
      <i>Spain</i> has promis’d his Daughter <i>Cademore</i> in Marriage to
      the King of <i>France</i>; but <i>Theorbeo</i>’s Passion for our
      Soveraign, was the Cause of his helping his Sister in the Escape from
      the Arbitrary Power of a Father, and is daily expected to arrive in
      this City: So ’tis Fear, Hope, Love is the Cause of his Distress.

      amongst the purest Spirits: Oh that this too, oh too, too dear, tender
      fond Heart could yearn, and sigh no more! Constancy destroys me, Love
      makes me Heavenly, and Tears refine the Soul: as a Pilgrim I will
      travel till a Hermitage I find; I’ll mourn, I’ll wander to
      <i>Ovid</i>’s solitary Tomb; I’ll pity that poor unfortunate Man; I’ll
      think of her I love the most, and pour out my Tears upon him; there

      <i>Primo.</i> We all in one Night had the fame Vision; gazing
      stedfastly upon your Dominions, the Hills sunk down to Vales, and the
      Valleys rose up to Mountains, upon which a Giant stood, swelling huge
      with arroganting Poison; his horrid Visage reach’d the Skies, grasping
      a Sword in his Hand that flam’d from Earth to Heaven, glittering on
      high, and blaz’d in Elemental Fire, upon whose mighty Edge, Death rode
      triumphant: Then in Fury, as Lightning upon the Wing, slunk down,

    <p>
      <i>Dolo.</i> By the Emperor’s Imperial Command he was forc’d into the
      Amphitheatre, there to be devoured by the hungry Jaws of a Lion;
      disarm’d he enter’d, taking from his Heel his Ammunition Spur, he
      wrench’d it wide, and gripe’d it thus.

      Monster hugely rouz’d himself aloft, stalking gravely he enter’d,
      flinging from his Talons sedentary Pain, with Scarlet fiery Ogles
      ken’d all around; but when I saw the Beauty of <i>Greece</i>, my Heart
      was all Granade, I had an Army within, a Centry guarded every Pore,
      and this Compound of Elements thundred. The Lion came at me amain,
      with Jaws open, dreadful as the Mouth of Hell, he sprang aloft, I
      glanc’d, he mist me, then with rebound he turn’d, and by the Main I
      caught him as he flew, and over his Back I threw myself astride; then
      with my Knees I crush’d his Ribs and Heart together, and with my
      Right-hand Spur I cleft his Skull: I bruis’d the Pan of his Brain,
      till Flashes of Lightning flew swift from his Eyes; I stabb’d his
      Sight, he twisted, he grinn’d, he turn’d and loose he broke, bloodily
      blind as he was, in raging Storms, in circling Whirlwinds flew; his
      burning Heart, that swell’d with Anguish, Fury and Revenge; his Talons
      tore the Earth, rent the Flints, he gnaw’d the Ground, and Choler
      boiling over, churning Dust, Blood and Foam, he roar’d tremendous.

    <p>
      <i>King.</i> ’Tis a furious Description; but how did you conquer him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hurlo.</i> My Coat I roll’d up thus, and hurl’d it to his Breast;
      then eagerly grasping the Prey, I march’d towards him, I spurn’d at
      his Heart; he reel’d, I retreated; he recover’d, I advanc’d; again I
      struck, then trembling, he disgorg’d a Flood of Gore, and stifling
      with the Stream, bolt upright he rose; I pursued my Strokes, he
      fainted, he sunk, he shiver’d, he died.

      and satisfy my own Soul; for when my Crown adorns the Head of a worthy

      thou in long Eternity shall shine; and if my Happiness be no more than
      what I conceive in thee, and that to last for ever, then let the World

      <i>King.</i> I could lay me down, and dissolve my Body by thee, and
      make my Soul to swim away to thine in Floods of Tears: Oh
      <i>Theorbeo</i>, thy Body was inhabited once by all things fine,
      Faculties that rous’d aloft within, ready to heave up the Sky, and
      force themselves to Heaven; full of an humble Grandeur, Resolution,
      Ambition divine, that mighty he, that wings the Soul: ’tis impossible
      that so much Greatness should ever cease to live; oh here let me stay,
      till thy Breath of eternal Raptures, shall descend from Heaven in
      Harmony; when thy bright Spirit, like the Sun, shall glance from the
      Sphere, I’ll leap up in Extasy, and meet thee in the Air; when we
      descend, I’ll stand to pause, to gaze, admire, rejoice and weep; I’ll
      parry thy Beams, run into thy Rays, and clasp thee in my Arms; if I
      become blind; but now sleepy Nature calls to rest, and as our Bodies
      slumbering sympathize, may our Souls in extatick Visions meet.

      <i>Theorbeo</i>’s Kingdom; is it thus we pass from lasting Sleep, and
      wak’d to Life by a Choir of Angels? This inimitable Sound makes all my

      <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>will it vanish?
      To-day or ever? Momentary or eternal? declare those blooming Thoughts;
      a Pearl and Heavenly Mystery lodge within thy Eyes, ripe with Anity,
      appris’d with Tidings from on high; oh tell to me the Case of separate
      Souls; or in the Rapidity of thy Career, catch me away in a divine

      <i>Dolo.</i> The King was no sooner enter’d the Room of Burning-Glass;
      but it scorch’d his very Soul; crying out aloud to Heaven, with
      fervent Oraison, the Sun seem’d to start, and vail’d his Face with
      Clouds; for when he reflected on what was done, he mourn’d and wept,
      he wetted all the World with Tears: when we were both releas’d from
      our Chains, he drew the Vesture from his Eyes, and smil’d on all the
      Earth.

      pitches his Pavilion round thee, leave thee and march to the higher
      Regions of the Air, then rise up with his glittering Glory, and
      eclipse the Sun; O <i>Theorbeo</i>, I celebrate a Dunelmo in my Heart,

      <i>Sem.</i> Pray my Sovereign Lord hear us, let Pity move; the meanest
      of Kings pardon small Offences, and the mightiest of Kings may stand
      in need of Mercy; your Majesty knows that Greatness is seen more in a
      Man, when Mercy exerts in Lowliness, than when he rides in Fury, upon
      red-wing’d Thunder to revenge.

    <p>
      <i>King.</i> Rise up, I’ll hear no more, I can guess at what you’ll
      say. (<i>Ex.</i> Sem. <i>and</i> Ser.) My Enemies are the Rod of
      Heaven, that seldom ceases to torment: How mean a thing it is for Men
      to beg that Life, that is in the Hands of the greatest Adversary? No,
      they cannot live, their Breath would infect the Air, who would turn
      loose Dragons, Wolves and Tygers, I am not safe upon my Throne; yet
      Wisdom, in the highest Philosophy, tells me I am fate? for if there be
      a Power above, I am the Shadow of that Power below; and if so, not all
      the Power of my Adversaries, and all the furious Infernals, can stir a
      Shadow the Breadth of a Hair, except they have power to move the
      Substance. I cannot bear to have an Enemy; if I destroy these Men,
      they go down to the Dust unconquered: I never knew a Temper, not of
      the most inveterate kind, but I could conquer it, and force the Man to
      love me. When Ambition, Revenge and Passions rise, then Reason
      strengthens, and Love stands up and demands a Parly; and when my
      vanquish’d Adversary stands before me, it is equal to me whether I
      strike or kiss.
